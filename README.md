**Introduction**

GOAL: Our intention is to give shoppers of our storefront the option of an AR experience of a product with an android application.
A complete virtual experience online store which gives users the chance to experience the masks, clothing and other commodities in AR. 

As of this year, Google has recently announced many more ARCore features to be made available over the web(which is currently pending public release) and Android. Having implemented ARkit and Arcore, we felt itâ€™s time to get the word out there on the true capabilities of these features. 

## TECH STACK:
##### Java (android studio) 
##### Unity 
##### Arcore 
##### Blender 
##### Firebase 
##### Javascript 
##### HTML
##### Spark Arstudio
